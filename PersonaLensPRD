## Product Name: PersonaLens  
**Prepared By:** Allen Smith  
**Date:** May 15, 2025

## 1. 🎯 Product Overview

**PersonaLens** is an AI-powered intelligence tool that takes natural language queries (e.g., “What do investors think about OpenAI’s latest model?”) and searches across publicly available sources—news, social media, blogs, and open data—to return sentiment insights and trend analysis **segmented by persona** (e.g., investors, developers, journalists, policymakers). This allows users to understand *who thinks what*, and *why*, about a topic, trend, or brand.

## 10. 🙋‍♂️ Open Questions

- Should users be able to define custom personas (e.g., “climate tech VCs”)?
- Will there be manual moderation or feedback loops on misclassified data?
- Is multi-language support a priority for initial markets?
